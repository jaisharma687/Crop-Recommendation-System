# Crop Recommendation System Using AWS & Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for the *Crop Recommendation System deployed on AWS* project. The system uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most suitable crops based on soil parameters such as temperature, moisture, pH, and nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).

The project is integrated with AWS services like SageMaker, S3, and EC2 for model training, deployment, and scalability.

## Overview

As the global population grows, sustainable and efficient food production becomes increasingly critical. This project presents a cloud-based solution for real-time soil parameter analysis and crop recommendations. Using machine learning, we provide farmers with actionable insights to enhance productivity and resource management.

## Key Features:
- Real-time monitoring of soil parameters
- Crop and fertilizer recommendations
- Integration with AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment
- Scalable architecture using AWS EC2 and S3 for data storage
- Web interface for real-time interaction

## Technologies Used
- *Amazon SageMaker*: For model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.
- *Amazon S3*: For data storage of large soil datasets and machine learning artifacts.
- *Amazon EC2*: For hosting the web application.
- *Amazon Route 53*: For DNS management and domain mapping.
